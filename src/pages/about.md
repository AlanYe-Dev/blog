## About my blogs

It has been a long journey since the first day I built my first website in 2015, and my first blog in 2017. 
From WordPress, to GitHub Pages, then WordPress... and finally right here, on Astro.

I actually barely maintained my passion on writing blog posts, so it hasn't been a walk in the park.
The main purpose of writing blogs is to remind me previous journeys, and to look forward.

Every click on my links, every reaction, every comment, can make my day and help me maintaining this interest.
Thanks for your support! 🥰
