> For the Chinese version, [click here](/about/)

I'm Alan, a student, developer, and tech enthusiast. While I primarily speak Chinese, I'm also proficient in English.

This is the place where I write about some tech and casual stuff.

## About the blog
It has been a long journey since the first day I built my first website in 2015, and my first blog in 2017. From WordPress, to GitHub Pages, then WordPress‚Ä¶ and finally right here, on Astro.

I actually barely maintained my passion on writing blog posts, so it hasn‚Äôt been a walk in the park. The main purpose of writing blogs is to remind me previous journeys, and to look forward.
